After common installing you can use following markers within your saved searches:

	__CurrentUser(<ATTRIBUTE>)__
	
	To retrieve user attributes from current user e.g.
	
	__CurrentUser(EmailAddress)__
	
	Which results into
		$session{'CurrentUser'}->UserObj->EmailAddress
	
	__First__
	
	Beginning of the Unix Epoch:
	
	1970-01-01 00:00:00
	
	__Now__
	
	Unix actual local timestamp (based upon user timezone)
	
	__Midnight__
	
	Midnight of the actual timestamp:
	
	2012-01-03 17:35:22 -> 2012-01-03 00:00:00

Some query examples:

* Getting tickets due:

id > 0 AND (  Due < '__Midnight__' and Due > '__First__' )


* Getting all watched tickets:

id > 0 and (  
	Cc.EmailAddress = '__CurrentUser(EmailAddress)__' 
	OR AdminCc.EmailAddress = '__CurrentUser(EmailAddress)__' 
	OR Requestor.EmailAddress = '__CurrentUser(EmailAddress)__'
)
