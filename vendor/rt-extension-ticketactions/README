NAME
    RT::Extension::TicketActions

DESCRIPTION
    Provides easy access to frequently used ticket actions.

    Also so called "follow-up" actions set the ticket status to `stalled`
    and add a relative due date with a fixed time. This means that a ticket
    should be due in x days. This combination of properties can be used in
    searches or escalations to bring tickets up to users. In addition
    holidays of a specific country and specific days of week can be skipped
    automatically, if enabled.

    In addition to that, this extension provides navigation items if you
    have opened this ticket from a search result listing. You can navigate
    between search result tickets (first, previous, next, last), open the
    search result list again or even modify the search query.
