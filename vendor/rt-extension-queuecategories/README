NAME
    RT::Extension::QueueCategories

DESCRIPTION
    Allows you to categorize queues by a specific custom field.

    In addition to the default functionality of custom fields, this
    extension utilizes the values of this custom field to group queues in
    the following areas:

    Quick Ticket Creation Dropdown
        The one in the top right corner.

    QueueList Dashboard Element
        The one that comes by default with RT.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.2

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::QueueCategories');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    In order to enable this extension's functionality it is required to
    create a custom field first. This custom field needs to be of the type
    "Select one value" and have the name "QueueCategory". (Although the name
    is configurable, see below)

    Once the custom field has been created, define the categories you want
    to use as values for the field. Remember to apply the field to those
    queues you want to categorize and to manage authorization before
    continuing.

    Now edit each queue you want to categorize and choose a value for the
    custom field. That's it.

  Order of Categories
    It's possible to adjust the order of categories by defining a sort order
    for each value of the custom field. If no custom sort order is provided,
    categories are sorted alphabetically by default.

  $QueueCategories_CFName
    An alternative custom field name to use.

   Example
    Set($QueueCategories_CFName, 'Queue Group');
