## About

You can use this extension e.g. for the following scenarios:

* Immediately visualize open tasks with customer replies on tickets.
* Highlight workflow steps with custom fields. Ticket bought -> on hold, action required. Ticket received -> say thanks, close ticket.

The search result rows can be highlighted matching defined conditions:

* Custom name matches value
* Last Updated By is not the ticket owner or in a specified group

The rows can be highlighted with

* Transparent background color
* Icon as an additional column from the extended search editor.

### Highlight on Relative Due Date

]
);
```
