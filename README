    to their homepage dashboard.

            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

CONFIGURATION

    By default, all privilegued users are shown. There is a known problem
    with users which don't own any tickets being hidden.

    If you want to show specific groups, you can configure an array of group names:

        Set($UserSearch_Groups,
        [ "development" ]
        );

    Navigate into Admin - Global - Group Rights and select the group to modify.
    Select the Rights for staff tab and tick Show the usersearch box.

    Users need to edit their dashboard and add the RT-Extension-UserSearch droplet.
